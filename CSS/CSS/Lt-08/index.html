            A winter morning in Bangladesh showcases nature’s soft beauty with cold, misty air spreading everywhere. 
            When people wake up early, they find a thick fog covering the entire landscape, hiding the sun’s light.

            Dew drops on leaves and grasses glisten like tiny pearls, creating an enchanting scene. 
            Poor people gather around small fires to warm themselves, while children love to run and play, feeling the crispy cool air on their faces.
